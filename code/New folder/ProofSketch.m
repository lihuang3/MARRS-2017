%% Outline

% For a branch junction pt p1, it connects branches and leads to the next
% branh junction pt p2. 
% To show a location p is a good local gathering pt, we aggregate nearby
% robots to this pt p, and then deliver them to p2 to finish this intermediate task

% We skip any monotonely gradient ascend path to p, since such path indicates the path
% from p to p2.
