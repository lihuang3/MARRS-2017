\begin{abstract}
Microrobots have great potential for microassembly and non-invasive surgery applications. %to be used for  micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and medical applications, such as , etc.  
%We present efficient strategies for collecting a swarm of simple microrobots in 2D vascular networks using a global input.
 %These physically preliminary microrobots usually work in large populations, but they have limited capabilities of actuation, computation and communication. 
%{\color{red}\#}Potential applications of these microrobots require large populations, but individual microrobots have no actuation, computation, or communication capabilities.
% Therefore, a shared input signal (such as optical signal, gravitational force, or electro-magnetic fields) is employed to provide external actuation and navigation. 
Motivated by studies proposing MRI-guided drug delivery to tumor cells using magnetic micro carriers, this paper studies two major challenges of this problem: (i) microrobot swarm trajectory generation, and (ii) swarm aggregation using a global input. 
We propose an augmented RRT for trajectory generation to reduce environment interference, and a divide-and-conquer algorithm for swarm aggregation to improve performance.
%We propose Trajectory generation of a microrobot swarm is based on an obstacle-weighted RRT algorithm, {\color{red}\#}which gives a path optimized to guide the majority of micro particles from one topological region to another despite  environment interference.
 %an optimized path with the global control input to reduces environment interference. 
% The divide-and-conquer aggregation algorithm {\color{red}\#}presented in this paper employs the environment to drive all microrobots to a goal location with a shared input.
Simulations demonstrate the utility of these approaches in comparison to alternate heuristics. Our trajectory generation and aggregation strategies are implemented on a swarm of ferromagnetic microparticles in oil using a 6-coil electromagnetic system with image feedback.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}
This paper compared two path-planning methods and two control strategies applied to the problem of aggregating microrobot swarms in vascular networks using a global input. 
Although RRT creates an obstacle-free path from initial locations to a goal for a single robot, this path is not ideal for swarms. 
We propose an obstacle-weighted RRT that steers microrobots towards near-medial-axis regions to reduce environment interference.   
A divide-and-conquer strategy is employed to perform swarm-level aggregation via discrete region transitions. 
Compared to the benchmark strategy, the divide-and-conquer aggregation reduces the task time complexity.    
%In future work , we plan to augment our research in theory and experiment. 
%We will prove the convergence of our aggregation algorithms, compare more path planning techniques, test microrobots in different maps and construct a more delicate electromagnetic platform for micro-scale control.
Future work should prove the convergence of our aggregation algorithms and explore a wider variety of maps.
